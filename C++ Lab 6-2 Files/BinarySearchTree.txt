The focus of these problems will be working with information extracted from a 
municipal government data feed containing bids submitted for auction of property.
The data set is provided in two comma-separated files:

  1. eBid_Monthly_Sales.csv (larger set of 17,937 bids)
  2. eBid_Monthly_Sales_Dec_2016.csv (smaller set of 179 bids)

This assignment is designed to explore a binary search tree algorithm using 
bids loaded from a CSV file.

We provide a starter console program that uses a menu to enable testing of 
the sort logic you will complete. It also allows you to pass in the path
to the bids CSV file to be loaded, enabling you to try both files.
In this version the following menu is presented when the program is run:

   Menu:
      1. Load Bids
      2. Display All Bids
      3. Find Bid
      4. Remove Bid
      9. Exit
   Enter choice:  

The BinarySearchTree.cpp program is partially completed - it contains empty methods
representing the programming interface used to interact with a hash table.
You will need to add logic to the methods to implement the necessary behavior.
Here is the public API for LinkedList that you have to complete:

  public:
    BinarySearchTree();
    virtual ~BinarySearchTree();
    void Insert(Bid bid);
    void Remove(string bidId);
    Bid Search(string bidId);

Begin by creating a new C++ Project with a Project Type of "Hello World C++ Project".
Name the project 'BinarySearchTree' and click Finish. This will create a simple 
BinarySearchTree.cpp source file under the src directory. You can then download the 
starter program and copy the files to the src directory, replacing the existing 
auto-generated one. Remember to right-click on the project in the Project Explorer 
pane on the left and 'Refresh' the project so it adds all the new files to the src 
folder underneath.

You will need to perform the following steps to complete this activity:

(1): Internal structure for tree node, housekeeping variables

(2): Implement inserting a bid into the tree

(3): Implement removing a bid from the tree

(4): Implement searching the tree for a bid

Hint: Lab3-3 used a Node structure for implementing a linked list. 

Here is sample output from running the completed program, with dashed lines to 
illustrate the separate activities:
